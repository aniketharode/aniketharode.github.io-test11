       <p>I am currently working at the TCS  and having an experience of 2 years in java technology<br>
       I am using the struts 1.3 ,hibernate technology,spring.My role is to the code as per the requirement<br>
       I am working at the NSDL project which deals with the securities(shares) of the owners.Here we have to <br>
       deals with the settlement of the securities from owner (BO) to the DP(i.e banks) we make sure the <br>
       that the proper settlemnet is takes place or not</p>

             <h3>My PortFolio</h3>
        <p>Firstly i have make these portfolio my taking the full container having the background image
        and which is set to flex column so that the all the outher elemnet in the container is in the 
        column form.The heading of the portfolio is in container form which is in flex wrap so that the
        two image arrange into the row wise and if the screen resolution gets changed it gets wrapped.
        Here i use the trasition property concept whose opacity is set to minimum but it can be visible 
        as it is in background.Whenever the mouse hover over it it gets seen fully in whole container.
        The second container is used for describing myself which is a simple container and use  the 
        box shadow  property.Third container is used to describe my hobbies it has the heading tag 
        which can increse the size of the text whenever the mouse over it.The background images are 
        used by using the background tag.I have mentioned the some of my hobbies which used the property 
        of the transition so whenever the mover hover it it's background colour got extends.When the 
        screen gets resized to the 599px these backgrond images gets aligned to column wise by changing 
        the property of the background tag.<br>
        Third container i used is describing about my current technologies i am using and future tecnologies 
        which i am interested in.for these inside the container i have created the two container one is for
        current where i have used some images and used the flex wrap so all the images comes in one row and 
        during screen resizing these images gets wrapped up.again here as well i used the trasition property
        of 0.5 second with ease so in 0.5 second the whole screen filled with some test whenever the mouse 
        hover it.simillarly i used it with the lower sub container as well.take a note that the whenever the 
        screen gets resized these transition can be seen only by double clicking so i set the overflow tag as 
        the visible in  screen resizing.<br>
        Fourth container i used is for describing my professional experience these container have the mouse 
        hover property and the container is treated as the box shadow.Fifth container is same as the above 
        container difference is only in the overflow is set to scroll as the para is bigger in height so the 
        user can scroll it to read it.
